**Kinematics** is the branch of physics that deals with the motion of objects without regard for the forces causing the motion. Kinematics is concerned with the description of motion, such as displacement, velocity, and acceleration.

**Displacement** is the change in position of an object. It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. The magnitude of displacement is the distance between the object's initial and final positions. The direction of displacement is the direction from the initial position to the final position.

**Velocity** is the rate of change of displacement. It is a vector quantity that has both magnitude and direction. The magnitude of velocity is the speed of the object. The direction of velocity is the same as the direction of the object's motion.

**Acceleration** is the rate of change of velocity. It is a vector quantity that has both magnitude and direction. The magnitude of acceleration is the change in speed per unit time. The direction of acceleration is the same as the direction of the change in velocity.

The following are the three kinematic equations of motion:

1. **v = u + at**

where:

* v is the final velocity
* u is the initial velocity
* a is the acceleration
* t is the time

2. **s = ut + 1/2 at²**

where:

* s is the displacement
* u is the initial velocity
* a is the acceleration
* t is the time

3. **v² = u² + 2as**

where:

* v is the final velocity
* u is the initial velocity
* a is the acceleration
* s is the displacement

**Derivation of the kinematic equations of motion**

The kinematic equations of motion can be derived using the following relationships:

* velocity = displacement / time
* acceleration = rate of change of velocity

**Derivation of the first kinematic equation of motion**

v = u + at

* Let v be the final velocity of an object.
* Let u be the initial velocity of the object.
* Let a be the acceleration of the object.
* Let t be the time interval.

The average velocity of the object is given by:

average velocity = (displacement) / (time)

(v + u) / 2 = (s) / (t)

where s is the displacement of the object.

The acceleration of the object is given by:

acceleration = (change in velocity) / (time)

a = (v - u) / t

Substituting the expressions for average velocity and acceleration into the equation for the change in velocity, we get:

(v - u) / t = (v + u) / 2t

Solving for v, we get:

v = u + at

**Derivation of the second kinematic equation of motion**

s = ut + 1/2 at²

* Let s be the displacement of an object.
* Let u be the initial velocity of the object.
* Let a be the acceleration of the object.
* Let t be the time interval.

The average velocity of the object is given by:

average velocity = (displacement) / (time)

average velocity = (s) / (t)

The average velocity of the object is equal to the sum of the initial velocity and the final velocity divided by 2.

average velocity = (u + v) / 2

Substituting the expression for average velocity into the equation for displacement, we get:

s = (u + v) / 2 * t

Substituting the expression for the final velocity from the first kinematic equation of motion, we get:

s = (u + u + at) / 2 * t

s = ut + 1/2 at²

**Derivation of the third kinematic equation of motion**

v² = u² + 2as

* Let v be the final velocity of an object.
* Let u be the initial velocity of the object.
* Let a be the acceleration of the object.
* Let s be the displacement of the object.

The first kinematic equation of motion can be written as:

v = u + at

Squaring both sides of this equation, we get:

v² = u² + 2uat + a²t²

Substituting the expression for the displacement from the second kinematic equation of motion, we get:

v² = u² + 2as
